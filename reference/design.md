# Design system

The colors, spacings and patterns the dashboard is built from. Two reasons why this is here:

1. **If you build your own tools**, you can style them with these values. Then they look like part of the same system and not like five different programs.
2. **If Claude designs something for you**, you just say "stick to `reference/design.md`" and get a consistent result instead of a new look on every attempt.

All values are defined in the dashboard as CSS variables (`context/today_template.html`, right at the top). Change them there and the whole dashboard changes with them.

## Attitude

Calm, matter-of-fact, little color. Color always means something here: green is the system itself, amber and red are warning levels. Everything else is neutral. Whoever uses color as decoration takes away its meaning.

## Colors

**Accent (the system itself)**

| Token | Value | What for |
|---|---|---|
| `--brand` | `#177B57` | Active elements, accent lines, the current tab |
| `--brand-deep` | `#0B3F2D` | Text on light green surfaces |
| `--brand-soft` | `#E8F1ED` | Surfaces with a green backing |

**Surfaces and text**

| Token | Value | What for |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#F7F8F7` | Page background, slightly warm instead of pure white |
| `--card` | `#FFFFFF` | Cards and panels |
| `--text` | `#0D1F1A` | Headings, important values |
| `--text-2` | `#3F4D47` | Body text |
| `--text-3` | `#7A857F` | Labels, secondary information |
| `--border` | `#E2E6E3` | Normal dividing lines |
| `--border-strong` | `#C8CFCB` | When an edge has to be more distinct |

**Warning levels**

| Token | Value | What for |
|---|---|---|
| `--sev-amber` / `--amber-soft` / `--amber-border` / `--amber-deep` | `#B54708` · `#FEF3E2` · `#F8D5A4` · `#92400E` | Attention, but not urgent |
| `--sev-red` / `--red-soft` / `--red-border` / `--red-deep` | `#B42318` · `#FBE8E5` · `#F5C5BE` · `#911C13` | Overdue, failed, blocked |

There are no more colors than these. If you need another meaning, first check whether one of the existing ones already carries it.

## Spacing, corners, shadows

| Token | Value | What for |
|---|---|---|
| `--pad` | `20px` | Inner padding of cards |
| `--gap` | `14px` | Spacing between cards |
| `--shadow-1` | `0 1px 2px rgba(13,31,26,.04)` | Resting surfaces |
| `--shadow-2` | `0 4px 16px rgba(13,31,26,.06)` | Highlighted surfaces |
| `--ease` | `cubic-bezier(.2,0,0,1)` | Every movement, so nothing feels hectic |

**Radii:** `999px` for chips and pills, `10px` for cards and panels, `6px` for small surfaces like code chips. No more steps than that are needed.

**Typeface:** `Inter`, if it is on the machine, otherwise the system font. Deliberately not loaded from outside, so the file works offline.

## Patterns

**Card:** white surface, `--border`, `--shadow-1`, `--pad` inside. Heading in `--text`, content in `--text-2`, labels small in `--text-3`.

**Status at a glance:** a colored dot or a colored edge, never a colored block. Set up is green, not set up is grey, not red. Red is reserved for broken, not for unfinished.

**Technical values** (commands, paths, keys) always in monospace and usually on their own calm surface. The user should see immediately what they can copy.

**Empty areas** get a calm sentence about what will appear there and how to fill it. Never an empty field and never an error message when there is simply nothing there yet. A freshly set-up system must not look like a broken one.

## Limits

The dashboard is a single HTML file that works on a double-click. Therefore: **no external fonts, no icon libraries, no CDN, no build step.** Icons are embedded SVG, fonts are system fonts. Whoever builds in an external dependency makes the file useless offline.
